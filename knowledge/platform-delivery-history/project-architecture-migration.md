# Project Architecture Migration

> Historical migration record: the paired Git content-repository model below is superseded. The accepted model derives one TreeDX **virtual knowledge repository** from every root project. A project may also be content-only and omit a primary Git repository. Seeds declare root projects only; virtual knowledge repositories are created, reconciled, and retired through the control-plane/TreeDX lifecycle and never participate in GitHub workflows.

## Superseded paired-repository decision

Every TreeSeed project has two independently governed repositories:

- the primary repository is the software workbench;
- the `{primary-name}-content` repository is the knowledge and asset history.

The seed stores both normalized GitHub identities. Content repositories are not workspace submodules and software build, test, and deployment jobs must not clone them. Git remains the durable content history, TreeDX is the only operational query and mutation path, and Cloudflare R2 is the published runtime plane.

Projects use `split_site_content`, `localContentMaterialization: none`, and an R2 runtime source. Local feature development resolves the staging publication plus an immutable preview overlay. It never silently reads a removed `src/content` directory.

## Ownership

- SDK owns repository-policy contracts, desired GitHub units, migration journals, exact-ref verification, TreeDX publication receipts, and R2 channel pointers.
- CLI parses commands, enforces confirmation, and presents SDK results.
- API owns durable project and content-repository bindings plus assignment-scoped TreeDX authorization.
- TreeDX owns content workspaces and changesets in its own repository custody.
- The platform-operation capacity provider may execute approved repository and publication operations.
- Agent providers may author content only through assignment-scoped TreeDX operations.

No service receives both a software checkout and a content checkout as an implicit shared filesystem.

## Repository federation and local worksets

The final development model does not use a parent repository's gitlinks as portfolio authority. Software repositories remain independent and are joined by an SDK-owned `treeseed.integration-change-set/v1` receipt. Each receipt records normalized remote identity, role, source branch, exact commit, dependency names, package/lockfile contract digests, verification disposition, governed execution authorities, and fresh remote read-back. Its identifier is derived from that canonical state rather than from local paths or a parent commit.

`trsd save` is single-repository scoped by default: it saves only the independent repository containing the invocation directory and emits a repository-scoped receipt. Cross-project work is performed in an assignment-owned ephemeral workset materialized from authenticated live team project inventory; `trsd save --federated` records and pushes the checked-out repositories in dependency order and emits the integration receipt required by stage. `trsd stage` rejects repository-scoped receipts, verifies that every federated remote still matches the receipt, runs the integration proof, and promotes those exact commits. `trsd release` consumes the staged receipt and its proof instead of reconstructing a portfolio from a checkout.

A clean Platform clone assembles that workset through the SDK-owned operation:

```bash
npx trsd platform workset --plan --json
npx trsd platform workset --apply --yes --json
npx trsd platform workset --apply --yes --branch feature/assignment-change --assignment <acting-assignment-id> --json
```

The clone itself is initialized from one canonical Platform template. A Platform "profile" is not a second schema or runtime selector: it is the exact immutable template revision recorded in machine-local template state. The default TreeSeed development installation is created with:

```bash
npx trsd platform init ./platform \
  --repository treeseed-ai/platform --ref staging \
  --template platform-local-managed-codex --team treeseed --plan --json
npx trsd platform init ./platform \
  --repository treeseed-ai/platform --ref staging \
  --template platform-local-managed-codex --team treeseed --apply --yes --json
```

The initializer freshly observes the requested remote ref, validates the template from that exact Platform commit, and rejects a wrong origin, moved commit, nonempty target, or tracked template divergence. Template bundles may contain managed source scaffolding, seeds, scene manifests, and verification configuration. They reject credentials, journals, databases, workspaces, worktrees, caches, logs, traces, screenshots, videos, rendered scenes, and other generated evidence. The default template is byte-identical to the staged Platform repository's managed files, so initialization leaves tracked source clean and records composition only under ignored `.treeseed` state.

The command permits only unique, workspace-contained software paths from the authenticated team inventory. Planning observes each configured live branch and freezes its exact commit in the plan; apply uses the central token when configured, creates independent repositories atomically, and records `.treeseed/worksets/platform/latest.json`. A writable branch requires an acting assignment whose team, project, accepted/scheduled/active capacity plan, decision, workday, exact base commit, repository scope, and expiry match the workset. That project alone receives `assignment-write` custody; every other inventory repository is detached and read-only. Readers recompute the receipt's canonical inventory and authority digests before treating any path or base commit as managed authority. It never resets or deletes an existing path. A dirty checkout, wrong origin, unexpected branch, moved commit, nested repository, Market identity, content-repository identity, expired authority, or tampered receipt is blocking drift. Repeating a successful apply against unchanged live inventory produces only `noop` actions.

During the transition, the existing Market workspace may retain software submodules and the recursive save adapter. That adapter emits the same receipt and may update gitlinks for compatibility, but stage identity is the receipt, not the gitlinks. Content repositories, Market, and Market API are never materialized into a Platform workset. Clean-clone workset, stage, close, recovery, and release-plan acceptance now passes without `.gitmodules`; the compatibility adapter remains only until active development has cut over from the Market workspace to Platform worksets.

### Governance and autonomous project teams

The portfolio contains 31 repositories, not one 31-way writable checkout: thirteen Platform-managed primary repositories, their thirteen content repositories, the fixture repository, and the four singleton Market repositories. A project team owns one primary/content pair and publishes contracts other teams can consume. Seeds create the initial team resources but do not remain membership authority. The live team project inventory owns membership and repository bindings; a workset materializes only the repositories needed for a task; TreeDX mediates content; project-local proposals and decisions authorize source-changing work; integration receipts bind the resulting exact refs.

The governed execution chain is:

```text
proposal revision -> accepted decision -> assignment graph -> reviewed checkpoint
  -> governed execution-authority receipt -> repository save
  -> federated integration receipt -> stage candidate
```

An execution-authority receipt contains project, proposal revision/hash when available, decision, upstream decision dependencies, assignment graph/node, approved deliverable, canonical repository, exact base/checkpoint/integrated commits, and changed paths. It is stored in workset-local state so an independent repository is never dirtied by coordination metadata. Save embeds it only after proving that its integrated commit remains in the saved repository history. For repositories materialized by a verified Platform workset, federated save also diffs the exact inventory commit and rejects every non-generated changed path that lacks a project-matching authority rooted at that commit. Replaying the same checkpoint preserves its stable authority identifier.

The final Codex/CLI development architecture has one source-changing lifecycle: project proposal, accepted decision, planning workday, estimate, accepted capacity plan, acting workday, project-scoped assignment, review, and execution receipt. Planning may inspect, estimate, ask questions, and create proposals before approval, but acting may not edit source without that chain. An integration receipt never treats an umbrella objective or another project's proposal as implicit authority. Direct ungoverned edits are transitional legacy behavior, not a second final workflow.

This is the migration's critical product outcome across all 31 repositories. Admin UI, CLI, interactive Codex, scheduled agents, and provider runners are interfaces or execution providers over the same API-owned lifecycle. Interactive Codex must attach to an admitted assignment before it receives repository custody or mutation tools. The assignment supplies the team, project, decision, workday, capacity plan, allowed repository and paths, base ref, tool policy, TreeDX handles, expected outputs, and verification contract. No interface may mint broader authority locally.

Codex is the default execution provider for TreeSeed agents. Provider manifests declare that default explicitly and advertise it with live availability, so API-side assignment selects the default before repository custody reaches a runner. Project or team capacity policy may select another compatible configured provider for a particular assignment and takes precedence over the provider-local default. Default selection never bypasses admission: it chooses how an authorized assignment executes, not whether the assignment is authorized.

Every durable action must be reachable through the API and the authenticated CLI; every guided UI action must invoke that same API contract. Agents receive assignment-scoped forms of those capabilities. An action available only through UI code, an unwrapped shell command, or a provider-private tool is incomplete. CLI/API descriptor parity and a CLI-driven end-to-end development initiative are release gates for the internal development system.

Retiring local-on-disk development means retiring human-owned, long-lived writable checkouts as development authority. Git object stores, TreeDX storage, and temporary checkouts may still exist on disk as implementation details, but they are isolated, assignment-owned custody and are disposable after checkpoint integration. A locally seeded TreeSeed team is a valid control plane for development; bypassing that local instance to edit and promote a repository is not.

Repository scope is progressively discovered, but agent acting authority is never widened in place. A proposal authorizes an intended outcome and its meaningful constraints; it is not required to predict every repository before investigation begins. Planning workdays inspect the live team project inventory, produce estimates, and record linked questions, notes, dependencies, or project-local proposals through TreeDX. Accepted capacity plans and assignments freeze the project and work boundary for acting. If acting discovers an unplanned repository dependency, the assignment records that dependency and returns to planning instead of editing the new repository. Planning worksets may inspect additional inventory members read-only; writable custody is created only for admitted assignments. Stage freezes the saved receipt set into an exact candidate; any later addition or ref change requires project-local authority and a new receipt.

### Local runtime and assignment isolation

The persistent local Platform control plane inventories every active team project, but inventory membership does not imply a permanent checkout or a running service. A Platform deployment profile selects the runtime capabilities needed by that installation. An admitted assignment separately selects the source repositories needed for its deliverable and their transitive contract dependencies. Those repositories are materialized as independent, exact-ref Git worktrees inside assignment-owned custody; unrelated team repositories remain API/TreeDX inventory only.

The provider manager reconciles an assignment-qualified runtime composition from that custody. PostgreSQL, TreeDX, API, web, capacity, and optional AI services run only when the verification contract requires them. Source may be mounted from the isolated worktrees for hot reload or built into exact images for parity testing. Containers never broaden repository authority: Codex receives only the assignment checkout paths, TreeDX handles, allowed operations, and credentials admitted by the control plane. Package verification runs first, followed by the smallest integrated runtime and guarantee set that proves the affected contracts.

Visual inspection is evidence, not a prerequisite for every change. A UI/API assignment may request a short-lived authenticated Cloudflare preview. Reconciliation owns the assignment-qualified tunnel, DNS name, access policy, expiry, verification, and cleanup; the checkpoint records its URL and exact source-closure digest alongside screenshots, traces, and browser-test results. Preview identities must never reuse singleton Market DNS or remain after their owning assignment/review window closes.

Cross-project execution therefore has two dependency layers. Decision dependencies express that Project B is not authorized until Project A's project-local decision or contract is accepted. They do not grant Project B's proposal authority to create assignments or edit files in Project A. Every changed project requires its own proposal, accepted decision, assignment graph, reviewed checkpoint, and repository receipt. Repository dependencies then express that B's exact source candidate consumes A's exact commit or package contract. An umbrella objective or coordination proposal may link the initiative, but it cannot replace those project-local authority chains. Proposal dependencies are normalized into each proposal content hash; decision creation resolves and snapshots accepted same-team dependencies; the API graph compiler revalidates those snapshots and overwrites caller-supplied authority metadata; assignment checkpoints carry durable assignment trailers; save requires a matching authority and unchanged governed paths; and stage asks the resolved control plane to revalidate every embedded authority before candidate creation. The stage candidate hashes and persists that validation evidence. The remaining federation provenance gate is coordinating content-publication receipts with the same candidate.

## Repository policy

Seed repository policy declares visibility, `create-or-adopt` or `adopt-only`, `retain` or `archive`, fixed `main` and `staging` branches, and GitHub feature settings. Deletion defaults to retain. Repository creation, adoption, settings, branch verification, and remote read-back flow through SDK reconciliation.

Production GitHub mutation is hosted-only. Local `trsd seed repositories` execution is limited to local and staging and requires an inspected plan plus explicit confirmation.

## Migration lifecycle

Each content extraction follows one journaled operation:

```text
validate -> observe source/target -> extract exact refs -> push target -> verify target
  -> bind TreeDX -> publish immutable R2 release -> verify gateway
  -> remove software content path -> save exact repository graph
```

The operation preserves content history from `main`, `staging`, and the active migration branch, maps package `docs/src/content` to content-repository `src/content`, and does not copy software release tags. Replay succeeds only when source, target, branch, tree, TreeDX, and R2 digests match the journal. Unexpected content or ref movement is blocking conflict.

History bootstrap is deliberately applied one project at a time after live repository reconciliation:

```bash
npx trsd seed content-repositories treeseed --project admin --plan --json
npx trsd seed content-repositories treeseed --project admin --apply --yes --json
```

Repository renames and organization moves use the parallel source-history operation before content extraction:

```bash
npx trsd seed source-repositories treeseed --project template-engineering --plan --json
npx trsd seed source-repositories treeseed --project template-engineering --apply --yes --json
```

The source operation pushes exact historical refs into empty targets, permits only journal-proven fast-forward augmentation for a required workflow, and blocks unexpected target history. This is the path used to move the template repositories and the public Market repository into `treeseed-ai`; it does not deploy either repository.

Platform is intentionally not migrated with the generic source operation because this transitional workspace still contains the Market application. Its dedicated extraction composes a filtered workspace snapshot from live package/template/fixture refs and excludes Market code, assets, content, host manifests, singleton seeds, and Market repositories:

```bash
npx trsd seed platform-workspace treeseed --branch staging --source-ref <market-staging-sha> --plan --json
npx trsd seed platform-workspace treeseed --branch staging --source-ref <market-staging-sha> --apply --yes --json
```

Platform content uses an explicit skeleton migration mode so root Market content can never be mistaken for Platform-owned content.

The operation authenticates every `treeseed-ai/*` read and push with the central `TREESEED_GITHUB_TOKEN`, mutates exactly one explicit branch, and reads every snapshot file from the supplied exact committed Market ref rather than the ambient worktree. It rejects a source ref that is not the freshly observed head of that branch, a journal owned by another branch/ref, and non-fast-forward or unreceipted target history. Receipts record source ref, snapshot digest, target branch, target commit, and fresh remote read-back. A `history_verified` journal requires independently verified main and staging receipts; this task mutates staging only and leaves main unchanged. TreeDX binding and immutable R2 publication remain separate required cutover gates. Migration journals prove repository creation/history, while integration change-set receipts prove a development or promotion candidate; neither may be substituted for the other.

The old software-repository content workflow remains in place until the matching content repository and R2 publication verify. After cutover, content publication is manual or release-driven through `trsd content publish`; a Git push does not directly mutate R2.

## Live authority checkpoint

The staging migration now treats live GitHub repositories as input, not the seed manifest as evidence. The authenticated team inventory identifies Platform-managed primary/template/fixture repositories; workset planning observes their live refs and freezes exact commits in a receipt. Paired content repositories remain outside the software workset. Content repositories have verified `main`, `staging`, and migration-history refs. `trsd content publish --seed treeseed --branch staging` fetches each exact live staging commit into an isolated checkout, verifies the ref before and after publication, and writes project-scoped immutable R2 releases. Replays reuse every object and upload zero objects.

Local TreeDX reconciliation derives each paired content repository from the seed, fetches only its validated `refs/heads/staging` ref, compares the resolved TreeDX commit with fresh GitHub observations before and after fetch, and indexes that exact commit. Split-content projects never seed TreeDX from the software checkout. Interrupted Git fetch recovery is limited to an expired lock for the exact validated destination ref; unsafe or broad refspecs remain rejected. A converged replay must report `noop` for the TreeDX unit and an exact live-ref verification for every project.

This checkpoint authorizes package metadata cutover to `split_site_content`, `src/content`, `r2_preview_overlay`, and `localContentMaterialization: none`. It does not yet authorize deleting the old software content paths: each runtime must first prove it serves the R2 staging publication without a disk fallback.

The exact-ref publication manifest is also the canonical web-runtime manifest. Contract v3 includes immutable raw source objects plus a deterministic runtime projection (path-qualified entry identities, collection indexes, rendered source payloads, docs tree, and search index) under the same release root. Book-local knowledge slugs remain in entry data while repository-path-qualified runtime slugs prevent collisions between common page names such as `overview`. The environment-scoped channel pointer is `content/{teamId}/{projectId}/{environment}/channels/current.json`, where `prod` resolves to `production`. Published web builds register empty Astro collections and read that exact pointer from `TREESEED_CONTENT_MANIFEST_KEY`; they never probe a local content directory as a fallback.

Software-path removal requires a journaled four-plane gate:

```bash
npx trsd content cutover --seed treeseed --project admin --branch staging --plan --json
npx trsd content cutover --seed treeseed --project admin --branch staging --apply --yes --remove-software-content --json
```

The apply reconciles only the local TreeDX content unit, freshly verifies graph, search, frontmatter, and exact Git ref, compares the live software and content Git trees, requires the current R2 publication receipt, and writes `.treeseed/content-cutovers/<repository>--<branch>.json`. Removal is additionally blocked when the local legacy path is dirty or its `HEAD` tree differs from the verified live source tree.

## Runtime paths

Published objects are immutable:

```text
content/<team-id>/<project-id>/<environment>/releases/<content-sha>/manifest.json
content/<team-id>/<project-id>/<environment>/releases/<content-sha>/content/**
content/<team-id>/<project-id>/<environment>/channels/current.json
content/<team-id>/<project-id>/previews/<preview-id>/manifest.json
```

Production reads the production channel. Staging reads the staging channel. Local development reads staging plus an exact preview overlay when declared. Missing staging content is a readiness blocker, not permission to fall back to disk.

## Rollout gates

1. SDK repository reconciliation and migration recovery tests pass against local bare repositories.
2. Isolated GitHub lifecycle acceptance passes and cleans all test resources.
3. Staging R2 publication and gateway verification pass.
4. One project completes extraction, replay, and software-path removal.
5. Remaining projects migrate in dependency order.
6. Push-triggered software content workflows are removed only after all matching content repositories are authoritative.

No production content or repository mutation is authorized by this document alone.
